Permaculture Design Course Pamphlet XV - Permaculture for Millionaires

So what is the logical way to go about this? Put the site into
the Permaculture Institute. Then everybody receives the eternal
right to that part of production in which they are interested.
The Permaculture Institute holds and manages rights. Now
that’s a good proposition! Because what are they getting? Very
low overhead, enriched crops, marvelous appearance in the
eyes of the world -- Look what we’re doing here! Everybody is
doing exactly what they want to do. Here are happy people who
are keeping their situation healthy, and which some supervising
designer, probably on site, trained in permaculture principles,
is making sure it’s working. Every one of those palm trees
takes little vanilla orchids. So the permaculture designer
starts stacking in, and he gives the care of the vanilla orchids
to yet another group.

**The rich don’t have anybody to tell them what to do.**

I see no reason for that not to happen. But what the rich
don’t have is anybody who can tell them what to do. I pointed
out that they are not immune from acid rain; they are not immune
from environmental disaster. They have no real desire to
be moving among dead lakes, in a world that the wood chippers
have stripped of the last of its forests, a world in which humankind
is stranded on a naked rock. They own that they worry
about it. But there is no leadership. They don’t know where to
look for leaders. They are thinking of funding schools to train
people to be leaders. There is nobody to tell them what to do
about the environment, how to handle this situation, give a businesslike,
reasonable proposition. Nor is it possible to link to the
alternative, because the alternative is not businesslike. The alternative
has set up no structures that can integrate with
ours. Now we have a structure. Here it is.

They understood. They can work in there with their banks;
they can work in there with their investments. We can give
spare lands over to them, of which we have several million
acres that we are not using for this or that.

So we were the first people they ever met who were really alternative,
really had ideas, really could suggest how they could
invest their money, and who had a structure to which they
could link. They just can’t be running around themselves as individuals,
or sending out people to try to find out how to link to
the movements that are going on, and how to work with those
movements to make a beneficial interface.

**Dirty money!**

Now there are those who say to us, "Don’t go with them, it’s
dirty money." But then, there they are and here we are. We
haven’t 10 years to sort it out. It’s war, or it’s cooperation. For
me it’s going to be cooperation because war doesn’t work. Opposition
doesn’t work. War replaces one lot of oppressors with
another lot of oppressors.

**There’s no opposition.**

There is no opposition in high echelons. So don’t go looking
for opposition; there is none. There is a high capacity for information
gathering very rapidly. If we have data on acid rain, they
can get it quicker. It’s just that they had never thought to look.
You give them that data, and say, "Go check it for yourself.
Don’t believe me." Do you know, this group can have it checked
in maybe four days and get a high impact statement that is absolutely
frightening? All they need to do is tell their very bright
secretary to do it, and she, maybe, has a degree in biochemistry.
She taps that acid rain, man, and brrrrrrrrrrrr.....

I said, "Look, I don’t want you to believe me, but I tell you what
-- I’ll give you four areas to look at and let you make up your own
mind as to whether you have a future. Look at soils, forests,
pollution, and acid rain. You look there." We are not meeting
any opposition. What we are looking at is complete acceptance,
acceptance of a real situation with a methodology to
which the investor can link. That’s the whole situation. That’s
the sort of methodology we are working out for them. It is a valid
methodology.

Companies are basically immortal. You can talk to a company
about putting in a 70-year investment. They look at very long
term investments.

Because you just can’t turn off all coal production, there are
two ways you can work on it. One is suppression of pollutants,
and the other one is very rapid generation of a vast resource
to replace coal. That’s got to be biological. Frankly, I also think
that we must go toward the decrease of energy use. You
might be moving toward a rapid development of biological resources
and at the same time assisting in the decrease of energy
use.

When we get to the end of that cycle, maybe nobody is making
much money; but look at the money Corning is going to
make out of your attached greenhouses. So you can spot in
these futures, and these are real futures. Capital can be
switched to energy decreasing modes; no problem doing that.

**Nobody is informed.**

But the investor doesn’t always have good advisor in these
fields, either. Their own people are unequipped to advise. They
are mainly graduates of economic schools and management
schools. Those who employ them are for the main part people
who inherited money. So nobody is informed. As soon as their
vision widens to a comprehension of the future, they may say,
Where can I use what I’ve got? or Where do I fit into this?

However, there is one problem. It’s easy at the top to get
these agreements, but that person usually has a set of underlings
who get on with the actual work. Now that’s where you
strike trouble. It’s exactly at the level of implementation that
you strike trouble, because underlings are in the sort of desperate
financial position where they are always looking out for
their own corner. They don’t want some parts of change, because
there is no corner for them, no way they can continue to
carry out the sort of operations to which they have become accustomed.
For this reason, it is the principals, rather than the
underlings, who must become involved in large scale permaculture
conversion.

Yet they must have assistance. What we need is thousands
of qualified permaculture designers, capable of handling the implementation
and managerial aspects. To set up these permaculture
systems on a scale of two or three million dollars investment
capital, or two or three billion dollar investment
capital risk, will take many designers full time for many years to
adjust it and tune it and extend it.

It is worth doing something that size, for that is going to be
effective as an example. The investor will be able to say, "Look!
This year we have water in, and we have apricots growing
around the water, and there are now ten families living here
that weren’t here before. This water stimulates the growth of
palm trees. In seven years time we may be getting crops off
here and here and here. Just look at what we are going to get!
And we are seven years ahead of everybody else!" It is a
10,000- liter an acre business, every year. With 500 acres of
that --What’s that worth compared to a liter of petrol? You
have a $5,000-an-acre business. So 500 acres of that is a
2.5-million-dollar proposition, and there are thousands of acres
of it--thousands of acres with presently not another thing on
them except starving people, a few dying cattle, and a few pariah
dogs.

Although it might be possible to shift 10, 20, 30-million dollars
capital across within a month or two, who, who is going to
oversee it? For this, you don’t want some inspired person who
wants to do good. You want a thoroughly competent person
who knows exactly what to do. So we are trying to train inspired
people to become competent. You can’t train competent
people to become inspired; but, again, we might well just
do that, too.

Now there are many, many of these propositions that are of
great interest to me. There are large areas of waste land, of
desert, and all of which have a fantastic potential for production.
In the Australian desert, land can be purchased at maybe
$120,000 for a 700 square miles, or $200,000 for 1,000
square miles. In such areas there are probably 500 miles of
excellent date washes, without anything else. Again, an enormous
output of sugars. And that still leaves most of your area
really untouched.

At the same time, an equal part of the investment capital
should be directed toward energy use. Do you know what we
need in deserts? We need sail freighters. We could sail any
desert in freighters, and large freighters, too. All we need is a
hundred foot wide strip which is sown down. All deserts have
constant winds of 15 miles an hour, blowing all the time, and
enormous loads could be sailed across the desert and straight
to the coast. Everything produced in the desert is self-stored. It
is in dry storage. So at the same time they are developing date
production, we want them to be building the technology that
cuts out the 600-gallon diesel engine tank, and the highway,
and the truck -- these things consume a lot more energy than
is necessary.

It doesn’t worry me if the investor doubles his money, providing
we can go on doing what we are doing, providing they leave
behind a huge number of people in charge of the land. In the
end, you see, what you have is levels of function. All the investor
buys is the product in which he is interested. The rest of it is
the people’s. That is all an investor is interested in when investing
in an oil well -- just the oil.

The cheapest way to make a profit out of a forest might be
to go and cut it down, chip it and leave. That’s happening. It is
happening because people aren’t persuaded that such a
course is a deadly action. So information becomes vital. It is
necessary to get this turned off. The man going to Borneo,
wood chipping it and running, isn’t usually an associate of these
investors. They are simply providing money at interest to fund
his operation. They are handling his account. When the people
providing money for these operations become convinced that
this sort of thing must stop, they can take that man out of
there within two or three months, just by slowing down and drying
up the flow of money. They can stop that operation without
doing anything that is illegal, no marches, no fuss. Now that is
all possible. Even the Mafia has to route money through financial
systems. If you have a lot of allies within those financial systems,
then you can stop certain operations much faster than
you can running around and sitting down in front of chain-linked
fences and getting arrested. But there must be a lot more of
us at it. What we’re in for is a persuasion job.

**Put my thongs under the bed.**

Some of us find all this enormously terrifying. It can throw a
person into totally unaccustomed conditions. You’re up 28
floors off the ground. Everybody is dressed smart and rushing
in all directions, talking millions of dollars like mere pennies.
The butler asked me, did I want to have my clothes laid out? I
said, "Yea, put my thongs under the bed." That sort of thing is
going on. You have private planes running you to and fro. I
wanted to have a look at some palm trees. The plane is chartered
to take me flying up the valley and land me, collect me
some seeds, and bring me back.

**We can link to any multinational.**

These people must become sold on what we are doing, must
become excited about this sort of thing, convinced that it is a
good thing. The beauty of it is that we have a system set up by
which we can link to any multinational. Now you can take on
amateurish methodologies that do not work and have no outreach
at all. Or you can take on a methodology that they know,
and which suits their financial and money transfer operation
extraordinarily well. That means large money for operations
there in India. And the spin-off benefits from those operations
they can pass on to the people of India.

The world is made up of two sorts of people that I approve
of. There are people who stay home and look after their house
-- I approve of those. And there are the people who are world-shakers.
I approve of those, too. What we are dealing with
here is the world-shakers.

We shouldn’t be running around on the face of the Earth doing
silly things. We should be centering in so that in two years
time when you look at the globe, see what we are doing on the
globe, it will look as if a lot of nuclei are all joining up. Everybody
will be enjoying this. The financiers will be enjoying it; the people
in the occupancy will be enjoying it; we will be enjoying it. It
seems to me that this is where many us ought to be heading if
we have any capacity at all.

All that we want is to rapidly get reforestation back on the
Earth.

There are these very large cattle and sheep ranching operations,
and, being scarcely financial, they are cheap. The people
who started up those ranches got the land for nothing, or for a
shilling an acre, or ten cents an acre. They stocked them with
half wild cattle. The sod went off, trodden into the ground. To
buy that land now, with 400,000 cattle on it, you will never
make money. So what we must see in property is a totally different
function. It is essential to get all the cattle off those
properties. In all of Australia, they probably don’t produce as
many cattle as in Essex in England. Thousands of cattle die for
every one harvested, and if the market is no good, they don’t
harvest. We need to get these very large areas under control
and very quickly. In one of those areas it would take ten of us to
even see half of it, let alone direct operations.

**Show that it can be done.**

Our job is to make resolutions in conflict, to set up social
meetings between people who have ideas and skills, and people
who have the power to move things. Let’s get a large section of
these arid lands, sell the commonwork idea and get cracking
out there on real arid land agriculture that counts on its own
rainfall to make production. Show that it can be done. Then
we’ve done a good thing. We give them all their money back.
They have good real estate that we have substantially improved,
and we have happy people all over the place carrying
out functions. I have two Australian aborigines who are superb
desert nurserymen. That’s the sort of consultants we want on
those jobs.
