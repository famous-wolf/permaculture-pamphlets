###PERMACULTURE FOR FIRE CONTROL

Fire in a landscape is a subject that I want to treat very seriously.
It is a common hazard.

Fire has a periodicity specific to the site. This fire periodicity
depends on two factors: First, the rate that fuel accumulates
on site. This is a critical factor. The second factor is the
amount of moisture contained on site. Any ridge top is far
more fire prone than its valley systems. Typically, the vegetation
of ridge tops may even be fire-dependent, with species that
germinate well after fire burns the ridges. In the valley, on the
other hand, you may get species that may be killed by fire, but
which burn very suddenly. While ridges are more fire-prone
than their adjoining valleys, so are the sun-facing sites more
fire prone than their shaded slopes.

It is possible to work out the fire periodicity on site by examining
the cross-section cut of an old tree in the area, or even
from historical records of fire in the area. With a rainfall of 30
to 40 inches, a catastrophic fire will occur about every 25 or
30 years. I am not talking about a local spot fire. I am talking
about a fire that races through a large area.

‘A lot can be done to change that cycle. Advantage is gained if
it can be delayed even one period. The less a site burns, the
less it is likely to burn, because there will be more humus and
more moisture incorporated into the site. On the other hand,
the more it burns, the more likely it is to burn again soon. This
is because fire removes a lot of moisture-retaining humus and
kills a lot more than it consumes, resulting in a fire prone litter
build-up. So the periodicity can change to a very short term if
an area continues to burn. Areas that naturally experience fire
every thirtieth year will burn every eighth or tenth year, once
they are being burned at shorter intervals. Fire is a very destructive
influence.

In permaculture landscapes, there are sequences of defense
that you must throw up. What you must do is reduce
fuel. That must be the primary strategy. You can do this by
creating non-fuel surfaces, such as roads and ponds, by constructing
swales and doing pit mulching, and reducing fuel by
means of browsing or grazing.

It is very simple to protect the house site. You only need a
hundred feet of non-fuel systems between the house and the
forest. That is not very far; it is a raking job. Select plant species
for this area that have fire-resistant characteristics, such
as very high ash content, a very high water content, very low total
bulk, and which grow densely. The ice plants, the
, some of the thick-leaf evergreen plants, whose littler decomposes
very fast, have leaves that are highly nutritious and
don’t last very long on the ground. A list of plant species useful
for fire control in any area varies with the climate. Fire departments
in fire-prone areas are often able to make
recommendations.

Some trees, particularly the pines, and many of the leaf species,
are litter accumulators. They form a hard and volatile litter
that simply builds up and carries very large ground fire. Do
not use plants to the fire danger side -- the downhill side --
which have high volatile oil content. Eucalypts are a positive nono,
and so are pine trees. Both are to some extent fire weeds.
Both carry cones and hard fruits that often don’t open until
fires. After fires, you will see a widespread covering of new
growth from the seed of these trees. That is what they are
waiting for, a fire to enable them to extend their range a little.

So you halt fires by working from the valleys upward with
plantings of low fuel vegetation. Re-establish the rain forest
that would be on the site if it did not burn. Bring in a lot of species
that naturally occur in the valleys.

Now let us look at the fire itself. What does the fire do? It
doesn’t burn much. It burns a few leaves, and perhaps buildings
in its path. The real danger of fire is radiation. Four hundred
feet before a fire, your hair catches alight. Two hundred
feet, your body starts to split and your fat catches alight. At
100 feet, you are a torch. Radiation kills birds hundreds of feet
from the fire. They just fall out of the air. Fire kills pigs very
quickly. They don’t stand radiation. Goats survive quite well.
They just lean into it. And human beings are good at surviving a
fire because they dodge about and hide behind shadows.

So we need to throw fire shadows over the central part of
the system that contains our client. We do it with earth banks,
and we do it with trees like willows and poplars that have high
water content and that throw out a black cloud of steam. They
don’t let radiation through. So on many sites that you will design,
where fire will be a future hazard, you pay a lot of attention
to setting up fire-protection. In California, almost every
plant depends on fire, and all have high oils, because they have
been selected through a long history of fires. Greece was once
a land of wet rain forests, with enormous oak and columnar
beeches. It has become a skeleton of its former self, and its
fire frequency is up and up. Now you really can’t burn Greece
because the dirt is burned, the plants are burned, the hills are
burned, the rocks slip down hill and you can’t burn rocks. The
whole of the Mediterranean and much of North Africa has
reached this condition.

What we must do is start reversing the process. If your
client is in that chaparral, then you must pay particular attention
to fire protection. You will have to give him somewhere to
go to when a fire comes. You really can’t save him on the surface.
So you dig a T-shaped or L-shaped pit and earth it all up. It
can be a length of road conduit, earthed over. Then your clients
can hop underground and wait it out. When they are out
of the radiation, they are out of trouble. In Coventry and other
areas that were burnt in war, there were fire storms. Standing
in a fire shelter, I have watched the glass pouring out of the
windows in my car. It is hot out there, you think. It melts out the
bearings in your car. You can’t drive. Always duck behind things
in a fire. Just get out of the radiation. And keep your mouth
shut. Don’t breathe. Otherwise, your lungs burn out. So if you
don’t breathe until you get behind things, you are all right. The
main thing is not to be in direct radiation. Often you can dig a
fire shelter into a bank with a backhoe. In some areas, this
work of a few minutes may be the critical factor for survival.

Otherwise, give good advise to your clients: "Go behind the
house and sit down ’til the front of the house is alright. Then
walk around to the front of the house, because the fire will
have gone past." Instruct clients about the need for litter reduction
on the ground. Give them good instruction in pit mulching
and swaleing. If you have a very bad fire site, construct a
few big swales, and cover the swales with old carpet so that
you get a very fast rot down. Put in a whole lot of plants that
are quite fire-proof. You can stand behind a Coprosma, and you
don’t even feel the fire, just a hot steam bath.

You can take advantage of the normal attributes of the raking
animals, such as chickens. They break up that ground litter
and mix it with oxygen so that it really breaks down. Short grazers,
such as sheep and wallaby, on the fire side, will reduce the
standing litter to one inch, and you will not need to worry about
ground fire.

Just experimentally, I have lit around mulches, and they are
not a risk. Sawdust, too, is good safe mulch. Actually, you may
get a half inch fire across the top. It starts to smolder burn,
but it doesn’t go anywhere. It can be quickly put out. You don’t
need to worry about mulches.

The primary protection in fire is to have good sprinklers
down hill. If you can turn on a couple of those, you can sit on
the front verandah and enjoy the sight of water pouring over
the landscape before the fire gets there. I’ve seen water from
the fireman’s hose coming six feet from the nozzle and going
up in the air as steam. If, before a fire gets there, you’ve turned
your sprinklers on, and the ground is wet, the fire won’t cross
that ground. If the fire is already there when you put the sprinklers
on, then the water doesn’t get very far out of the sprinkler.
So you must start your defenses before the fire.

Sprinkler systems on roofs are very critical. A house is lost
when ashes fall all over the roof, slide down it, prop against
chimneys and fill gutters. The wind is blowing; the heat returns
in under the roof and catches tar paper and insulation, and
starts burning from the ceiling under the roofing. That is the
way 99% of houses ignite.

The safest houses in fire are wooden. They have a 13 to 15
percent higher survival than stone or brick, which is a surprise,
of course. In analysis of some houses of equal risk that didn’t
survive, the brick outnumbered wood. Almost without exception,
stone houses are taken by fire. Stone transmits heat rapidly
to the inner surfaces. Bricks are equally fast heat transmitters.
You can burn a wood house with a blow torch if you go
around catching it in a lot of places. But a wooden house is
very resistant. Basically, wooden houses won’t transmit heat
through the fabric, and their drafting systems are better than
in brick houses. White painted wooden houses, and paint generally,
anything that will reflect radiation, is a protection.

When you are planning for fire, you must specify the use of
screens and fire hardware mesh, so that large particles cannot
enter the house system. The gutters should also be
screened. Wherever you are experiencing snow, fire, or heavy
leaf drop on the roof, it becomes necessary to put a rolledunder
section on the bottom edge of the roof, and put the gutter
back under, below that. Leaves will fall off. They can’t get in
the gutter. Snow will slide off. When snow melts, the melt will
go into the gutter. Fire ash will slide down and fall off. It won’t
get caught in the gutter, either. That is a good device, and it
can be fitted to existing roofs.

Put a monsoon sprinkler on the ridge of the roof. It is only
going to operate for a short period while the ash is falling. It will
be the most sensible fixture that you can put on a house. The
tap to it should be outside. Turn it on, and the whole house is
being washed down for an essential half hour. The roof is continually
washed, and the gutters are flowing. For this, you will
need a gravity system, and it needs to be yours, because if it is
part of a public system, every body will be drawing on it, and,
likely, the system will be inadequate.

You must say to your client, "Well, look, we will give you a few
simple specifics in housing design, and you must watch how
you lay out your roads and ponds. That will give you a much better
chance of survival." Also, advise your client about how to
proceed in case of fire.

Fire builds up to high intensity about 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. Inevitably,
the people at home are people with young children. Mostly,
they won’t have a vehicle. They are a vulnerable group, and
they must be told what to do. If the fire comes from this side,
they have to stand here with their woolies on, woolen jackets,
blankets over them, and a bucket of water so that wool won’t
burn. Then go into this little shelter that we have provided and
have a drink of water. We should try to get water in there. It’s
worth it. Just walk in there and sit down, and leave your woolen
blanket in the water. Dig that shelter into a little hill just at the
back of the house, normally away from the fire, on the slope.
Go maybe six feet deep. Open your back door, and hop down
into your little root cellar, which is also a fire shelter. We must
look after the people in ways like that.

Advise people never to jump into water in fire. That is another
no-no. There is no oxygen left in the water and they will faint
straight away. It is like painting somebody’s body. We breathe a
lot through our skins. The fish already are dying from oxygen
loss before fires ever get there. The people in the water will
faint and drown. So jumping in the pond is a no-no.

In some areas, we will totally ignore this whole business, because
for most of their history, those areas never burned. The
prospects of a sweeping fire are remote.

Even in humid climates, high forested areas in the continental
interior are not invulnerable to fire. When things dry up, and
the wind whips about at 50 to 60 miles an hour, just a backfire
from a car can set the whole area aflame. Fire travels about
400 miles an hour. There is no running away from it; no driving
away from it. When fire starts, it spirals up, and increases in
breadth at the base. You will be looking up at the sky, and there
is half of somebody’s house, way ahead of the fire -- an incredible
sight. You will be looking up at a blue sky, an upstream of
smoke, and there goes that burning house, a great fire in the
sky. Then it drops. At that point another spiral starts up. These
big spirals go up, taking everything that is burning with them,
then drop it out, to start new spirals. A fire will cover a thousand
square miles in an hour. So most people who are in it are
in it. You can’t go away from it. You have to just hold your
place and sit it out. Don’t start running. Don’t try to run ahead
of it. You have more chance of surviving a fire if you run
straight at it. If you run away from it you are dead. You have to
just hold your place and sit it out. Don’t start running. You can’t
drive your car, because the petrol will evaporate. Unlike Hollywood,
gas tanks never blow up; cars never catch alight; only
the tires do.

The sensible thing to do with high explosives, like drums of
fuel and the like, is to store them away from a living situation,
have them in separate sheds, a bit dispersed. When one ignites,
it doesn’t ignite the others.

Don’t put your poor client at the head of a converging valley
in the saddle. Don’t put your client where you would normally
put an efficient windmill. Don’t put him where the ridges converge.
No, no!

I witnessed an example of landscape architecture in an Australian
fire-prone site. I was driving by this place, and I looked at
this house -- I couldn’t believe it! There was an acre of fire-promoting
vegetation just across the way, converging eucalyptus
trees with pampas grass. It had been constructed by a
landscape architect. While the aesthetics were reasonable;
the function could be fatal.

So in my mind, function always comes first, then aesthetics.
A good function is often a very pleasing aesthetic. He could
have had a couple fire banks up the driveway. We could have
had given him a pond and, just below it, a Coprosma hedge.

Construct the pond in front of the house, with your road beside
it. The bank of the pond should rise toward the fire side.
You will find that there isn’t any conflict between good fire control
and good placement of your elements. But if you don’t have
the initial planning, all sorts of things can go wrong.
