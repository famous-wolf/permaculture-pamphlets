ELFIN PERMACULTURE DESIGN AND CONSULTING SERVICES
What Does an Elfin Permaculture Design Do?
A permaculture design helps people develop the specific lifestyle they wish to live in a specific place. Permaculture design clients
typically are environmentally concerned people seeking increased self-reliance. The design is a written report of recommendations
for achieving specific goals such as energy independence, food self-reliance, alternative incomes and so forth. The report compares the
stated goals, preferences and resources of the residents with the potential and ecological needs of the site.
The design provides the residents with a plan by which they can meet their objectives by constructive development of the site as a
whole system. In fact, the design process and the design itself are based on the principles by which Nature designs her ecosystems to
efficiently utilize conditions of soil, moisture, climate, sun, orientation and available species to make most efficient use of them and
produce as much life as possible both in quantity and in diversity.
Permaculture designs take a wholistic approach--everything is connected to everything else in the design for maximum efficiency.
Conservation of resources--the client's and Nature's --is the over-riding principle of permaculture design. Change for its own sake is
avoided and designs strive to become increasingly self-regulating and self-maintaining as they mature.
How is the Design Prepared?
Suppose that you notify us that you want a permaculture design. First, you buy from our sister enterprise, Yankee Permaculture, a
copy of our Permaculture Design Client Survey. This is about 18 pages of questions for you to answer as fully as possible.
Included in the purchase price is a review of your answers by the author, Dan Hemenway, Elfin Permaculture's lead designer. He
will recommend how to proceed. If you decide to have a design prepared by us, we will interview everyone involved and also
examine the site for which the design will be prepared. Based on what you want and what the site offers and needs, we will make our
report.
What Topics are Covered in an Elfin Permaculture Design?
Elfin Permaculture designs begin with a review of who the clients are and what we understand them to require from the design, as
well as a brief description of the design site itself. It is hoped that this detached narrative will give the client another perspective on
his/her situation and goals. The balance of the report consists of design recommendations.
Topics routinely covered in Elfin Permaculture designs are:
• Food and Nutrient Cycles. Food production is almost always part of the design. Permaculture designs typically specify tree
crops, unconventional gardening methods, and solar greenhouses as part of the domestic food production system. Aquaculture, bees,
small stock, poultry, and other foraging animals are frequently included. Soil management is treated in this section, as is disposition
of human wastes, development of forage systems, food preservation, and control of potential pests. For some clients, commercial food
production and/or processing is designed.
• Energy. All relevant options for energy production are evaluated, typically including solar, wind, water power, biomass, and
other biological forms of energy. Then we look at applications for energy such as transportation, space heating and/or cooling,
cooking, hot water, food preservation, and operation of equipment. After describing relevant conservation measures, we detail specific
proposals for utilizing available energy for the remaining work at hand.
• Water. With the availability of high quality fresh water in drastic decline worldwide, obtaining useful amounts of healthful
water is of paramount concern in the permaculture design. Typical domestic designs include roof catchment systems. Designs for
larger properties ordinarily provide for creation of ponds where runoff can be stored for gravity feed to the point of use. Systems
for treating and using greywater and other contaminated water are often part of a permaculture design. The water portion of the
design follows that described for energy above, first looking at the resources and then the needs. The design represents our best
thinking on utilizing such resources responsibly. In some designs, excessive erosion or destructive flood waters require special
treatment.
• Shelter. For existing housing, shelter recommendations of our designs detail retrofit for energy efficiency, food production, increase
in quality living space, and housing of plants and animals appropriate to the needs and desires of the client. If new buildings
are required, we often can recommend designs and construction methods which use local materials, preferably from the site. The
designs for new buildings save money and energy compared with conventional approaches. Shelterbelt plantings, shade in hot
weather and more efficient space utilization frequently result from design recommendations.
• Hazards and Problems. While hazards vary considerably from site to site, usually some of the following risks can be anticipated
and protected against to a degree: extremes of weather, earthquake, tsunami or tidal wave, fire, pollution and human violence.
Dangerous activities proposed by clients need to be addressed. These might be use of toxic substances, unfortunately common in the
practice of many crafts (e.g. chromium in leather work), or physical activities on site. For example, one set of clients proposed retiring
to the country after a lifetime of professional work and urban living, and cutting their own firewood. The risk of injury to unskilled,
unfit people in the very dangerous work of felling trees is about 100%. We expressed concern and proposed alternatives.
• Special Treatments. Often, a client will have a specific goal which is best treated in its own section of the design. One client had
a wetlands which could not be "developed" for environmental reasons. He wanted to get a personal benefit from it nonetheless. We
designed a use strategy that improved the water storage and purification function of the wetlands, protected adjacent wetlands, and
gave him some direct yields.
• Economics. Design implementation usually costs money. Permaculture designs achieve their goals while staying within the means
of the client. Almost everyone needs a certain amount of income. Our designs develop income when needed and provide ways to pay
for the design implementation when needed. Often a special interest or skill of the client can earn money utilizing the site's resources.
• Staging. Elfin Permaculture designs specify the sequence in which to implement the design recommendations and, where relevant,
how long each step should take. This enables us to use one aspect of the design to prepare the way for the next, permits generating
resources to implement the design as we go along, and avoids the confusion and overload of trying to implement the entire design at
once. Also, we believe that life-style changes are best undertaken in manageable steps so that the skills and behaviors required are
comfortably mastered before the next step is undertaken.
What Skills and Training are Needed to Develop a Permaculture Design for My Home?
No new skills or training is needed to implement any properly prepared permaculture design, except those which you have indicated
an interest or willingness to develop during the interview or in the survey. The design is intended to work with the client as s/he is
and the site as it is with no forced changes on either part. Techniques, management strategies, products and resources which may not
be readily available are all detailed in an extensive set of appendices to the design, including a bibliography for reading on specific
topics, a list of people and organizations who can provide skills, information or other resources you will need, a list of suppliers of
plants and products not commonly available and so forth. Our goal is to recommend practical measures which the client can actually
perform in a reasonable time. Appendices also furnish background information relevant to specific design recommendations where
this is the most practical way to provide it, species lists, and generic "standard designs" for problems which are common enough so
that it is more useful to develop a general design solution rather than treat it in the highly customized design report.
What Living Situations Call for a Permaculture Design?
Our design experience includes urban, suburban and rural situations, large properties and small, and even rented properties. We
have design experience in almost all climatic regimes from the humid tropics to frigid climates in northern Ontario, Canada, and in
maritime, humid, and semi-arid climates. The main requirement for a permaculture design is to want one--to intend a lifestyle
that grows increasingly self-reliant while increasingly benefiting the Earth.
Then Do You Think Everyone Should Commission a Permaculture Design?
No! Whenever possible we recommend that the person(s) who want(s) a permaculture design learn to produce their own design. We
offer a three week Permaculture Design Course, the basic introduction for people who wish to work in the permaculture movement,
and a 10-day workshop, expressly for people to acquire skills to use permaculture in their own lives. Either is suitable training.
We do not host these programs ourselves but wait until some individual or group wants one sufficiently enough to do the work and
risk the money to host one. Permaculture is a self-reliance movement. Often someone who wants a design will host a course or
workshop on their site and get not only input from the instructor but also from the students who undertake a design for the site as
the major activity of the program. Only when attending or hosting a workshop or course is impractical do we recommend our
professional design services. Financially, it is much cheaper to host a course, even if it loses a bit of money (and it could earn
money), than to contract for a design. Sometimes a person who received introductory design training will engage us on a consultant
basis to help with one component of the design where experience is critical. They then incorporate our advice into their design.
What Kind of Consulting Work Do You Do?
We can consult on any of the areas commonly treated in the design. (See above.) Besides siting a house on the property, we think
the most useful consulting work we do is to help people evaluate real estate to buy. By obtaining and completing the Permaculture
Design Client Survey, many design problems "solve themselves" as the correct course of action becomes self-evident when the survey
questions are answered. Elfin Permaculture is also available to do specialized design work and research for other permaculture
designers.
How are Your Fees Based?
All design work by Elfin Permaculture begins when the client completes the Permaculture Design Client Survey. If the design job is
very simple, we can quote a design fee on the insights provided by the Survey responses. Otherwise, we defer our quotation until
after the client interview and site visit. These are charged at consulting rates, which can be deducted from the full design fee if the
client decides to proceed with a full permaculture design. At this writing, the minimum fee for any design work is US$1,000 plus
direct expenses. Large and complex designs can be done in stages whereby an overall design is prepared in broad detail and very
specific design recommendations are prepared as needed prior to implementation of that portion of the design. If we do not think that
we can save you money through our design services over a reasonable time, we will recommend another approach.
Does a Permaculture Design Replace Architectural and Engineering Work?
No. Permaculture supplements these other types of design when they are required. Whenever possible, it is helpful to have
architects and engineers work in collaboration with the permaculture designer.
Who Does Elfin Permaculture Design Work?
Dan Hemenway, founder of Elfin Permaculture, and Cynthia Baxter Hemenway, work as a husband/wife partnership in Elfin
Permaculture Designs. Dan, who does much of the design work, has taught permaculture design in a number of countries in North
America, Europe, Asia, and the Pacific Islands. He holds five diplomas from the International Permaculture Institute in Australia, operated
a homestead self-reliant in food and energy for a decade and has professional experience in food production and alternative
energy projects. Dan has been active in permaculture since 1981, Cynthia since 1988. She is a wholistic health practitioner and a
Certified Nurse Midwife, activities that she integrates with permaculture. Dan and Cynthia have practiced permaculture in their own
lives in Massachusetts, Ontario, Kansas, Florida and Georgia where they have lived. In addition, Elfin Permaculture Associates, an
informal group of cooperating permaculture designers, provides us with expertise in areas of health and health care, venture
economics, engineering and sustainable energy. From time to time, trainees in Elfin Permaculture's Advanced Permaculture Training
(APT) program may provide input to designs under Dan's supervision.

Forest Ecosystem Rescue
Network (FERN)
FERN PROGRAMS DISCONTINUED
• A weekend workshop, or better a
weekend conference, forms a FERN chapter.
We prefer to serve as catalyst to local
folks to define the local problem, set an
agenda, and initiate a strategy.
• Slide/lectures. We have three bodies
of slides. 1) Fate of Our Forests overview.
Documents various causes of forest loss
in both temperate and tropical regions, with
emphasis on "decline" of temperate
forests. Discussion follows on what the
people present can do to improve the situation.
2) Temperate tree decline. A rather
brute-force lesson in identifying trees and
forests in decline, including photographs
from Germany, the US, Canada and some
other countries. We usually use at least
two trays of slides in this presentation, and
everyone who sits through it recognizes
tree decline when they see it thereafter. It
is very motivating. Our most effective volunteers
recruited themselves following this
presentation. 3) We also have a body of
slides showing healthy forests. When
possible, we follow "2)" above with the
healthy forest slides, mixing in some more
decline slides well into the program to establish
the contrast between sick and
healthy forest. Once people see what a
forest should look like, they are even more
able to recognize a sick forest.
Permaculture Programs
Lectures. We offer a very effective
slide/lecture presentation that establishes
some of the environmental problems that
required the development of permaculture
and some of the principles we use in permaculture
design to address these problems.
It ends with examples of permaculture
design. No limit on number of attendees.
One Day Workshop. We arrive at the
site a day or so early and develop some
basic permaculture design ideas that can
be communicated in a lecture format.
When the participants arrive, we first review
some basic permaculture principles
and concepts, and then take a site walk.
Following the site walk, we begin to flesh
out the initial concepts for the permaculture
design for the place. It is useful to
make our basic lecture (described above)
available the evening before a one-day
workshop for people who want to make the
most of this very fast exposure to the permaculture
process. Limit: 40 attendees.
Weekend Workshop. This is our most
effective short program. (While normally
given on a weekend as the name implies, it
can be given any two days in succession.)
It begins with our introductory slide presentation
Friday night, followed by discussion.
The next morning, we explore
basic principles of permaculture design.
After lunch we have a field walk. (So far
very much like the one-day workshop).

Lectures, Workshops, and Courses
Brief Descriptions
Then we divide the participants into teams.
They prepare the draft design for the place,
meet back in class from time to time to
check progress, coordinate among the
teams, and impart any special information
that they may need. Participants are encouraged
to sign up for the team for which
they are least qualified, and then to solicit
information needed for their part of the design
from other participants, with the instructor
the consultant of last resort. The
instructor has spent time before the workshop
developing a design approach to the
site. He leads the design process when the
teams might otherwise bog down. By
Sunday afternoon, participants present the
first draft of a permaculture design. We
have surprisingly good carry-through into
the subsequent lives of participants with
permaculture concepts following a weekend
workshop. Maximum enrollment: 25.
10-Day Permaculture Design
Intensive. This workshop effectively
helps people achieve beginning competence
at permaculture design. It is so effective,
that we recommend it as a supplement
to the full Permaculture Design
Course, which covers much more information
but presents less opportunity for design
experience. In the 10-day program,
participants work night and day for 10 days
on a permaculture design for the workshop
site. (…or one very nearby, if necessary.)
The intensive begins with the standard
weekend workshop format, allowing opportunity
for some people to attend the initial
weekend if we are not able to fill the 10-day
program. Over the balance of the week,
participants refine and revise the draft
design produced in the first weekend. They
draft a full permaculture design report that
addresses shelter, energy, food, nutrient
cycles, health, aesthetics, economics,
community and other factors involved in
helping the residents of the site meet their
goals while nurturing the ecosystem
around them. Class work during the week
consists of presentations by the
instructor, and by knowledgeable participants,
on subjects necessary to complete
the design. Topics vary according to
problems and resources uncovered as the
design process unfolds. The instructor
brings all the outlines and slides and other
materials needed to teach the full, threeweek
permaculture design course,
selecting from these to meet the needs of
the group. Design work is often impressive.
Class meets Friday through Sunday of the
following week. Maximum enrollment: 30.
Two-Week Workshop. This program
resembles the 10-day intensive, except
that it begins on a Monday and therefore
does not include a weekend workshop at
its inception. The two-week workshop can
be less intensive than the 10-day program,
making the longer workshop more suitable
where most participants will be commuting
and therefore less likely to work every
night on the design project. Alternately,
the two-week program is very successful
as an intensive experience when we give
the workshop in translation. Even though
the amount of material imparted in the
classroom is about the same, the longer
time in which to work with the information
helps people better integrate concepts and
apply them better to their design project.
Class meets Monday through Saturday for
two weeks. Maximum enrollment: 30.
Permaculture Design Course. This
three-week program (five or six weeks in
translation) carries certification as a permaculture
design trainee for successful
students. The program is intensive and
inclusive, surveying a wide range of information
and concepts necessary to successfully
practice permaculture. It includes
class work, a student design project,
slide presentations, presentations by
the students, and extensive slides and
other audio-visual materials. A four-week
version covers the topic: Permaculture
Design for Communities. (Certification is
the same.) Maximum enrollment: 30. Elfin
Permaculture also offers a
Correspondence Permaculture Design
Course and an annual Permaculture Design
Course Online.
Advanced Permaculture Training
(APT) Programs. Elfin Permaculture offers
the same range of formats for advanced
permaculture, open exclusively to
graduates of a Permaculture Design
Course. Emphasis is on personal design
work and teaching permaculture. We do not
encourage permaculture design for others
as a career, however we will assist any
design course graduate to hone his/her
design skills. We develop APT program
outlines on a case-by-case basis. APT
also offers individualized guided programs
of one to four years for design course
graduates.
We now offer programs mainly in central
Florida, due to family health considerations.
The shorter programs
described hereusually draw participants mainly
from the immediate area while programs of 10
days and longer draw from the region and usually
attract some people from distant places. While
promotion is mainly the host's responsibility, we
can support your promotion in various ways, particularly
if programs are booked with ample lead
time. We consider a program to be scheduled when
we have received a deposit reserving the date.
