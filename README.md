# Bill Mollison's Classic 1981 Permaculture Design Course at the Rural Education Center in Wilton, New Hampshire

This series of pamphlets is an essential piece of my permaculture education. As a complete transcript of one of the first Permaculture Design Courses ever taught, it has an unmistakable rawness, which, coupled with Bill Mollison's unique voice, makes for compelling reading. In keeping with the history of this document, I decided in 2014 to fully revamp it for a new generation of users and technology.

The existing document was nicely laid out as a multi-column PDF. After discovering that the multi-column format was incompatible with my e-reader, I decided to copy the pamphlets into [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown), a plain-text format that enables easy reading and exporting to other formats, including ebooks. This will ensure availability and usability of these valuable pamphlets, and hopefully will enable another generation of adaptive reuse and new users.

My thanks to Dan Hemenway and Barking Frogs Permaculture for making this document freely available. 

Many more thanks to all the other volunteers who put MUCH more work in than I have, including Elizabeth Beyor, Thelma Snell, Lisa Barnes, and Meara Culligan who did the real heavy lifting of creating the document in the first place.

Thanks to Bill Mollison for developing this course and giving the lectures, and for developing the Permaculture concept with David Holmgren. Thanks to all the Permaculture teachers who uphold Bill's legacy of teaching.

Thanks to [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) for developing Markdown.

Thanks to <http://textfixer.com> for the [Line Break Removal Tool](http://www.textfixer.com/tools/remove-line-breaks.php) which made this project much easier.

A final thanks to you for reading this new version and for everything you do to practice permaculture in your own life.
